# EY AI & Data Challenge – Fork by Barbara Ángeles Ortiz

## Overview
This repository is a fork of the official EY AI & Data Challenge and contains my work for the 2026 EY AI & Data Challenge: Optimizing Clean Water Supply.

The challenge focuses on leveraging data and AI to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and equity of clean water supply systems.
This fork is maintained by Barbara Ángeles Ortiz and is used as a hands-on environment to explore:

* Data preparation and analysis workflows
* Machine Learning experimentation
* Optimization strategies for real-world resource allocation problems
* Snowflake ML and Snowpark-based development

## Project Description

This project explores how data-driven and AI-based approaches can be applied to optimize clean water supply systems under real-world constraints.

The work includes:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand consumption patterns and regional needs
* Feature engineering and data preparation for ML models
* Predictive modeling to estimate future water demand
* Optimization approaches to support efficient allocation of water resources
* Evaluation of solutions using performance and sustainability-oriented metrics
* The repository is structured to support reproducible experimentation and iterative improvement.

## Step-By-Step Guide
For prerequisites, setup, step-by-step guide and instructions, please refer to the [Developer Guide](https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/guides/ey-ai-and-data-challenge/).

When you are ready to learn more about ML Development in Snowflake, you can follow this Developer Guide called ["Getting Started with Machine Learning Development in Snowflake"](https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/guides/intro-to-machine-learning-with-snowpark-ml-for-python/#0).

In this guide, you will build a simple ML development workflow from feature engineering to model training and inference using Snowflake ML in Snowflake Notebooks on Container Runtime.
